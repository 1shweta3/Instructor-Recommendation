Machine Learning Project: Similar Instructors Recommender
Overview
This machine learning project aims to enhance the learning platform experience by suggesting similar instructors to users, similar to how social media platforms recommend similar users. The recommendation algorithm utilizes cosine similarity, providing personalized suggestions based on the user's preferences. The web interface is implemented using the Streamlit Python library.

Dataset
The dataset used for building the recommendation system  contain information about instructors and relevant features. It contains information like instructor id,instrauctor name which was generated using the faker library in python and instructors areas of interests.
Dependencies
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before running the project:

Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Streamlit
You can install these dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn streamlit
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/1shweta3/Instructpr-Recommendation.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd similar-instructors-recommender
Prepare your dataset:

Ensure that your dataset is formatted correctly with the required features. Place the dataset file in the data/ directory.

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

Explore the Similar_Instructors_Recommender.ipynb notebook to understand the data preprocessing, model training, and similarity calculation steps.

Run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
This command will launch a local web server, and you can access the app in your web browser at http://localhost:8501. Use the app to input instructor preferences and receive personalized recommendations.

Model Details
The recommendation algorithm relies on cosine similarity, which measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors. In this context, it calculates the similarity between instructors based on their features.

Web Interface Features
User-friendly form for inputting instructor preferences.
Real-time recommendations displayed on the web interface.
Clear and intuitive design for ease of use.
Future Improvements
Incorporate user feedback for continuous improvement.
Explore options for deploying the Streamlit app on cloud platforms.
Enhance the model with additional features for more accurate recommendations.
Feel free to contribute to the project, open issues, or suggest improvements. Happy learning! ðŸ“šâœ¨
